# jDominion
A basic form of Dominion with a GUI, recoded in Java. 

Compile and run Dominion.java
To compile:
  In jDominion\jDominion, type "javac Dominion.java" with cmd
  
To launch:
  In jDominion\jDominion, run "java Dominion" with cmd

What I need to do: 
  Impliment ways the game can end
  Fix resolution so it works with anyone's computer (though may not be readable on low resolutions)
  
Further resolution problems since last time I tested it, it is on my list of things to fix.
